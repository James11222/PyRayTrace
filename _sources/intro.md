# Welcome to PyRayTrace

A simple script to animate a ray traced scene using python. This code was adapted from the extremely helpful [Medium Post](https://medium.com/swlh/ray-tracing-from-scratch-in-python-41670e6a96f9) written by Omar Aflak. It is worth a 10 minute read to understand the basics of Ray Tracing. I adapted this code to be object oriented and include animation features.
